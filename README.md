# Feline-Reticulocyte-Detection-Analysis-using-YOLOv8-and-LLM-Integration
Cat Blood Cell AI Analyzer: YOLOv8 detects feline reticulocytes &amp; erythrocytes in smears, trained on 300x300 images. LLM provides diagnostic analysis. Saves model to Drive.
This end-to-end Jupyter notebook presents a complete pipeline for building an intelligent system to automate the analysis of feline blood smears. The project is divided into two core phases:

Object Detection with YOLOv8: The notebook begins by downloading a specialized dataset of feline reticulocyte images from Kaggle. It meticulously processes the data, converting PASCAL VOC XML annotations into the YOLO format. A YOLOv8n model is then trained from scratch for 100 epochs to detect and classify three critical blood cell types:

erythrocyte (mature red blood cells)

punctate reticulocyte (immature red blood cells with punctate staining)

aggregate reticulocyte (immature red blood cells with aggregated reticulum)

The model achieves impressive performance, with a test mAP50-95 of 0.841, demonstrating high accuracy in localizing and classifying these cells. The trained model is saved to Google Drive for persistent storage and future inference.

LLM Integration for Enhanced Analysis: The notebook goes beyond mere detection by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). This component is designed to interpret the detection results, potentially generating diagnostic summaries, explaining the clinical significance of the detected cell types, or answering natural language queries about the analysis. This fusion of computer vision and natural language processing creates a powerful, explainable AI tool for veterinary hematology.

Key Workflow Steps:

Data Acquisition & Preparation: Uses kagglehub to download the "feline-reticulocytes" dataset and structures it into a YOLO-compatible format.

Model Training: Configures and trains a YOLOv8n model using the Ultralytics library, with extensive data augmentation and optimization on a CPU environment.

Evaluation & Validation: Systematically evaluates the model on validation and test splits, reporting key metrics like mAP50 and mAP50-95.

Persistence & Deployment: Saves the final trained model (feline_reticulocytes_model.pt) to Google Drive and demonstrates how to load it for making predictions on new images.

Visualization & LLM Analysis: Provides comprehensive code for visualizing detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores, and integrates an LLM to provide contextual, language-based insights from the visual detections.
